                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (e.g., a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

                    <p>Java and JavaScript are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type-checking. JavaScript follows a syntax similar to Java's and is widely used in web applications. Unlike Java's language features, JavaScript supports a range of programming paradigms, including object-oriented and functional programming.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript engines interpret and execute JavaScript code. Modern browsers contain built-in JavaScript engines that execute JavaScript directly on the browser.</p>
